## Overview

This repository showcases my work on building a complete computer system, from hardware components to a working software stack. Inspired by *The Elements of Computing Systems,* all implementations are my own, with testing scripts and hardware simulator from [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org).

### Project Breakdown

1. **Hardware Design:** Logic gates, ALU, and a basic CPU using HDL.
2. **Assembler:** Converts symbolic machine language into binary.
3. **Virtual Machine:** Stack-based VM that runs high-level code.
4. **Compiler:** Translates a simple high-level language to VM code.
5. **Operating System:** A basic OS for the virtual machine.
